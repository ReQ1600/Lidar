# NOT FINISHED YET!

A simple (not very accurate) tool, that uses a laser Time Of Flight sensor to measure distance in 360 radius around itself, and send it through bluetooth to connected android phone that will display all the points and connect them, phone will also control everything.

It is created using:
* Arduino Uno
* VL53L0X time-of-flight sensor from Waveshare
* JK35HY28-0504 stepper motor
* TMC2209 v1.3 stepper motor driver from Bigtreetech
